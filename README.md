### Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

### Steps Performed
1. Loaded Iris dataset
2. Split data into training and testing sets
3. Trained a Decision Tree classifier
4. Evaluated accuracy
5. Visualized the decision tree

### Result
The model achieved high accuracy on test data.

### Conclusion
Decision Trees are effective and easy-to-understand
models for classification tasks.
